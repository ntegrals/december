## Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Decision-Making Framework
The agent now follows a structured decision process:
- **Requirement Analysis**: Classifies information as CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, or SUPPLEMENTARY
- **Decision Criteria**: Only codes when ALL conditions are met (clear intent, sufficient detail, defined scope, technical feasibility)
- **Clarification Protocol**: Asks specific questions when critical information is missing
- **Quality Assurance**: Validates output before presenting results

### 2. Security and Privacy Protection
Comprehensive security measures including:
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **XSS Prevention**: Proper output encoding and escaping
- **CSRF Protection**: Secure form handling and state management
- **Privacy Protection**: Data minimization and proper consent mechanisms
- **Secure Coding**: No hardcoded secrets, secure authentication patterns

### 3. Output Validation Protocol
Multi-stage validation process:
- **Pre-Implementation**: Security assessment and logic verification
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript compliance and import resolution
- **Security Validation**: Vulnerability scanning and credential checks
- **Functional Validation**: Feature completeness and error handling
- **Final Review**: 6-step validation before presenting results

## Decision-Making Process

### Information Classification

#### CRITICAL Information (Must have to proceed)
- Core functionality and UI requirements
- Integration points and data requirements
- Security requirements and privacy considerations

#### IMPORTANT Information (Needed for quality)
- Styling preferences and performance requirements
- Accessibility specifications and input validation
- Error handling approaches

#### SUPPLEMENTARY Information (Nice to have)
- Advanced features and future extensibility
- Personal preferences and optimization details
- Logging and analytics requirements

### Response Protocols

#### When to Code Immediately
- Clear implementation request with sufficient detail
- All critical information available
- Well-defined scope and technical feasibility
- Example: "Create a contact form with name, email, and message fields"

#### When to Ask for Clarification
- Ambiguous requirements with multiple interpretations
- Missing critical details about core functionality
- Unclear scope or technical constraints
- Example: "Add authentication" (method, flow, storage unclear)

#### When to Explain Only
- User asks conceptual questions ("How does X work?")
- Requests for documentation or tutorials
- Theoretical discussions without implementation needs

## Security Requirements

### Mandatory Security Standards
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **Output Encoding**: Proper escaping of user-generated content
- **Authentication**: Secure patterns with proper session management
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and input validation
- **Environment Variables**: No hardcoded sensitive data
- **Dependencies**: Only well-maintained, secure packages

### Privacy Protection
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary data
- **User Consent**: Proper consent mechanisms
- **Data Retention**: Clear retention policies
- **PII Handling**: Extra care with personal information
- **Secure Logging**: No sensitive data in logs

### Data Sanitization
- **Input Sanitization**: Clean all inputs before processing
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries
- **File Upload Security**: Validate types and scan content
- **URL Validation**: Sanitize URLs before use
- **HTML Sanitization**: Strip dangerous tags

## Usage Examples

### Testing Decision-Making
```bash
# Test intelligent decision-making
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/test/analyze-message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Create a user authentication system"}'

# Test security validation
curl http://localhost:4000/test/security-validation

# Test decision matrix
curl http://localhost:4000/test/decision-matrix
```

### Example Scenarios

#### Clear Implementation Request
```
User: "Create a contact form with name, email, and message fields"
Decision: PROCEED - All critical information provided
Action: Implement complete contact form component
```

#### Ambiguous Request
```
User: "Add authentication to the app"
Decision: CLARIFY - Missing critical implementation details
Action: Ask about authentication method, user flow, storage, etc.
```

#### Conceptual Question
```
User: "How does Next.js routing work?"
Decision: EXPLAIN - No implementation requested
Action: Provide explanation of Next.js routing concepts
```

## Best Practices

### Decision-Making Guidelines
- Always assess information completeness before proceeding
- Ask specific questions rather than open-ended ones
- Provide context for why clarification is needed
- Offer concrete options when possible

### Security Guidelines
- Validate all inputs before processing
- Never hardcode sensitive information
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use secure communication protocols

### Quality Assurance
- Complete implementations only - never partial code
- All imports must exist and resolve correctly
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Responsive design and accessibility considerations
